WIP 60&amp; low profile keyboard with the goal of easy compact storage hopefully via some magnetic attachment system. 


## Progress Report:
| |Task | Status | Notes |
|-|-|-|-
|Designing| Layout | Researching | 60% Split
| | PCB | Researching | Split 
| | Plate | Researching | 
| | Case | Not started | seems simple enough except for the magnetic mechanism I want
| | Plate and PCB mounting mechanism | Not Started | Gasket seems really popular nowadays
| | Bill of parts | Not Started | screws, heat inserted standoffs, magnets, diodes, microcontrollers, trrs connectors, etc.
| Choose | Switches | Not Started | Low Profile Kailh Choc V2 Switches
| | Plate Material | Not Started | Want Quiet
| | Case Material | Not Started | Want Quiet and possible transparent
| | Case Foam | Not Started | Optional, but not if transparent case
| | Microcontroller | Researching | Between Pro Micro and Elite C
| | Other hardware (TRRS, CapsLock LED, possible OLED screen, diodes) | Not Started | Connect the two halves
| | Stabilizers | Not Started | ... do low profile have stabs?
| | Keycaps | Not Started | Is it possible to get stepped capslock? also want something uniform or blank so I don't have to look at qwerty and also so I only have a single height to think about while designing the case closing mechanism, better be some nice double shot if it has legends on it.
| | Button for reset switch for flashing firmware easier | Not Started | Just to make it easier if anyone actually builds this.
| | Cables | Not Started | Keep in mind cable length and maybe color match or something.
| Assemble | Lube switches | Not Started | ... can you lube low profile switches?
| | Diodes on PCB | Not Started | probably test too
| | put more soldering tasks here later
| | Heat inserted threads/standoffs for the case | Not Started
| Program | Basic Firmware | Not Started | lowkey scared
| | Via Compatability | Not Started | Desperately want
